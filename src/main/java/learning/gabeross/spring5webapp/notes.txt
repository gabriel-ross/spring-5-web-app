* JPA is an ORM

* "leakage" describes us giving JPA an identity value to assign to these classes, and this value
  "leaks up" into the object models we've defined
    * the identity value is so that JPA knows how to store and retrieve objects of these
      types into a database

* defining these entities allows hibernate to persist them (?) into a database

* Spring uses MVC (model-view-controller) design patters (used in a lot of GUI or web apps)
    * client makes request to controller
    * controller fetches model (plain old java object), returns model to view
    * controller is just a traffic cop - just tells you where to look, doesn't handle stuff like db connections
    * the view reads in the model and renders the view for the client (ex. generating HTML to return to client)

* There are plenty of templating frameworks for generating html when throwing stuff on a webpage

* We'll be using "Thyme leaf" - a natural templating agent -> essentially a dynamic html file that
  can generate html elements using variables spring passes it
